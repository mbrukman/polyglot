# Japanese Kana trainer

This tool will help you practice your knowledge of
[hiragana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiragana) and
[katakana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katakana).

To start the practice session, you may use any of the following methods:

* view the [live demo](https://mbrukman.github.io/polyglot/lang/ja/kana/practice.html), or
* clone this repo and open `practice.html` in your browser, or
* run `open.sh` from the command line (which will open a browser for you with
  the same file)

Note that it will not _teach_ you hiragana or katakana; to learn, you may use a
book such as _Remembering the Kana_ by James Heisig, or the websites and mobile
apps mentioned below.

For an overview of hiragana and katanana and how I learned them, see [my blog
post][my-blog-post].
