# Japanese Kana trainer

This tool will help you practice your knowledge of
[Hiragana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiragana) and
[Katakana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katakana).

To start the practice session, you may use any of the following methods:

* clone this repo and open `practice.html` in your browser, or
* run `open.sh` from the command line (which will open a browser for you with
  the same file)

Note that it will not _teach_ you Hiragana or Katakana; to learn, you may use a
book such as [_Remembering the
Kana_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remembering_the_Kanji_and_Remembering_the_Hanzi#Remembering_the_Kana)
by James Heisig, a website, or an app.
